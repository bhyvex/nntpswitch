NNTPSwitch 0.12

Enjoy the NNTPSwitch Wiki at http://wiki.chiparus.net/index.php/NNTPSwitch
where i try to keep the latest documentation updated.

Upgrading notes (See below for installation instructions)

Your old config is likely to be incompatible due to the new accounting 
configuration. Mainly the configuration went from the acl/auth entries 
to the profile. 

In access.conf first add the Accounting keyword to your default profile, 
pointing to your default accounting module. Also update your other profiles.

Next, remove the authentication and accounting names from the auth and acl 
config, mostly at the bottom of the access.conf 

If you have something like this:
	auth * authname acctname profile
	acl 0/0 acctname profile

Change it to:
	auth * authname profile
	acl 0/0 profile

And put this in your profiles:
	Accounting acctname

Also, the levels have been removed from the servers.conf. To upgrade, just 
delete the level keywords from your servers.conf. Or leave them, the config
reader will ignore them.


Installation

For full pleasure run nntpswitch on linux. FreeBSD is reported to work, but also
reported to be buggy in some configurations. Solaris should also work if you
leave out some features. Try it and you know it.

You should have Perl installed in your $PATH. 

Install the following development packages. If you have debian use:
apt-get -u install libmcrypt-dev libldap2-dev libmysqlclient15-dev postgresql-dev

  make
  make install

"make" calls "make config" automatically. make config parses the 
nntpswitch.conf.in file and uses the values as defaults. 

  mkdir /etc/nntpswitch
  cp nntpswitch.conf-dist /etc/nntpswitch/nntpswitch.conf
  cp etc/overview.fmt /etc/nntpswitch/
  cp etc/servers.conf /etc/nntpswithc
  cp etc/access.conf /etc/nntpswitch/

Optionally copy etc/init.d to /etc/init.d/nntpswitch.

Edit all configs to match your configuration.

You can test your config using the command:

  nntpswitchd -t

If it works and it is your first try of running nntpswitch you should generate
an nntpswitch compatible active file. You can do so with the command:

  updategroups

Finally run nntpswitchd without options to start it.
